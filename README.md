# Data Science Assignments in R 
Data analysis homework assignments in R from four graduate courses in the biostatistics department at the University of Washington. From Fall 2020 and Spring 2021.
## Biomedical Data Science (BIOST 544)
### Homework 1
This analysis describes and evaluates the effects of the treatment, TFD725, on the probability of surviving more than 400 days across age groups in a Phase II clinical trial of 188 patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
#### Methods Used:
* Random Binomial Distribution
#### Files:
* Code: "HW1_Biost544_Schoof_20Oct2020.Rmd"
* Dataset: "nsclc-modified.txt"
* Final Output: "HW1_Biost544_Schoof_20Oct2020.html"
#### How to replicate:
* download dataset.
* change working directory in line 11 to match the file path for where you saved the dataset.
### Homework 2
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment being studied in a randomized trial using simulation.
#### Methods Used:
* Rerandomization and simulation to conduct a data-driven t test.
#### Files:
* Code: "HW2_Biost544_Schoof_29Oct2020.Rmd"
* Dataset: "HW2-adaptive-trial.txt"
* Final Output: "HW2_Biost544_Schoof_29Oct2020.html"
#### How to replicate:
* download dataset.
* change working directory in line  to match the file path for where you saved the dataset.
### Homework 3
The purpose of this analysis is investigate the relationship between gene expression, as defined by 54,675 different probe sets, and the percentage of necrotic tissue in a tumor. The data sets being analyzed includes genetic and clinical data on 152 patients.
#### Methods Used:
* Lasso model for feature selection and k-fold cross validation to determine which gene probes are predictive of cancerous tissue. 
#### Files:
* Code: "HW2_Biost544_Schoof_29Oct2020.Rmd"
* Dataset: "HW2-adaptive-trial.txt"
* Final Output: "HW2_Biost544_Schoof_29Oct2020.html"
#### How to replicate:
* download dataset.
* change working directory in line  to match the file path for where you saved the dataset.
### Homework 4
The purpose of this analysis is to assess the effect of smoking on bone mass density (BMD) in middle aged women.
#### Methods Used:
* Inverse probability weighting method in order to estimate 95% cofidence intervals for each estimate
#### Files:
* Code: "HW2_Biost544_Schoof_29Oct2020.Rmd"
* Dataset: "HW2-adaptive-trial.txt"
* Final Output: "HW2_Biost544_Schoof_29Oct2020.html"
#### How to replicate:
* download dataset.
* change working directory in line  to match the file path for where you saved the dataset.
